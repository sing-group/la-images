	<h1>Analyze data</h1>
	<p>The analysis execution is started by clicking on the <img src="Images/button-analyze-data.png"/> button of the toolbar, which will show you the <i>Analyze Data</i> dialog. As you can see in the following figure, this dialog requires you to introduce the ICP-MS acquisition parameters (refer <a href="datasetformats-xl.html">here</a> for a deepest explanation of these parameters):</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Data directory</b>: the directory where the dataset to be analyzed is stored.</li>
		<li><b>Standard</b>: the standard element in the dataset.</li>
		<li><b>Ablation speed</b>: speed set by the user in the laser operational mode as <b><i>continuous firing</i></b>.</li>
		<li><b>Acquisition time</b>: refers to the time needed by the acquisition of one point for all elements monitored by the ICP-MS.</li>
		<li><b>Space interval</b>: is the distance among the center of two lines.</li>
	</ul>	
	<div align="center">
  		<p><img src="Images/analyze-data-dialog.png" border="0"/></p>
  		<p><strong><i>Analyze data</i> dialog</strong> </p>
	</div>
	<p>If the <i>parameters.conf</i> file is present in the data directory, then the data acquisition parameters are automatically loaded. You will notice that loaded parameters are highlighted with a green background.</p>
